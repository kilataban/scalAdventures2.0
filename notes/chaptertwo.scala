//This chapter entails more aspects of the Scala Language
/**This includes but isn't limited to HoF (Higher Order Functions),
Tail Recursive functions and Polymorphic HoFs that use types as a guide toward implementation

  *Scala code must be in an Object or Class with curly braces
  * The object keyword creates a named class with a single instance, also known as a singleton type
  * Return types of functions are inferred in Scala however it is always good form to declare them
  * A pair of braces containing statements is referred to as a block
  * A val is an immutable value
  * main is a special function because when a program is run, Scala will look for a method named main
  * main has to take an array of strings as an argument and return a String
  * A return type of Unit is often an indication of side effects
