//PURE FUNCTIONS
/* A pure function is loosely defined as a function without side effects

A function f with the input type A and output type B is a computation that relates every value,
a of type A to exactly one value b of type B, such that B is determined solely by the value of a

Any change of internal state is irrelevant to the result of the function f(a)

If it really is a function, it'll complete one singular task
